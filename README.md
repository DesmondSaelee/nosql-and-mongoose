## About 

This code demonstrates how to use nosql and mongoose to create models, controllers, and routes. These routes will be used to get all , get by Id, put (update), post (create), and delete corresponding information. It will also show how to make data related. When creating a user the user will have thoughts related to that user. When creating a reaction that reaction will be related to a thought. When creating a friend it will be related to another user. Also, When deleting a user all the related datas or user's thoughts will be deleted.
